    <h2 class="text-center">What is BMI?</h2>
    <p>
      Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measurement of a person’s weight with respect
      to his or her height. It is more of an indicator than a direct measurement
      of a person’s total body fat. BMI, more often than not, correlates with
      total body fat. This means that as the BMI score increases, so does a
      person’s total body fat.

    <p>
      BMI calculation BMI in an individual is calculated by the use of a
      mathematical formula. It can also be estimated using tables in which one
      can match height in inches to weight in pounds to estimate BMI. There are
      convenient calculators available on internet sites that help calculate BMI
      as well. The formula is - BMI = (Weight in kilograms) divided by (Height
      in metres squared) A normal BMI score is one that falls between 18.5 and
      24.9. This indicates that a person is within the normal weight range for
      his or her height. A BMI chart is used to categorize a person as
      underweight, normal, overweight, or obese.

    <h4>Clinical relevance of BMI</h4>
    <p>
      BMI is an indicator of total body fat in many individuals. Thus it is
      considered as an indicator of health risk. BMI is used by healthcare
      professionals to screen for overweight and obese individuals. The BMI is
      used to assess a person’s health risks associated with obesity and
      overweight.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example those with a high BMI are at risk of:-
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>high blood cholesterol or other lipid disorders</li>
      <li>type 2 diabetes</li>
      <li>heart disease</li>
      <li>stroke</li>
      <li>high blood pressure</li>
      <li>certain cancers</li>
      <li>gallbladder disease</li>
      <li>sleep apnea and snoring</li>
      <li>premature death</li>
      <li>osteoarthritis and joint disease</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      BMI, however, is one of the tools that are used to calculate healthy risk.
      Other factors such as blood pressure, cholesterol level, blood sugar
      level, family history of heart disease, age, gender, waist circumference,
      level of physical activity, menopause status, smoking status etc. are also
      taken into consideration while assessing health risk.
    </p>

    <h4>Is BMI applicable for all?</h4>
    <p>
      For most people, BMI can be used to provide a good measure of obesity. But
      BMI fails to provide actual information on body composition like amount of
      muscle, bone, fat, and other tissues. In some persons BMI is a more
      accurate measure of body fat than others. For example, persons who are
      very muscular may fall into the “overweight” category when they are
      actually healthy and very fit. These persons with a very low body fat
      percentage could have the same BMI score as someone who is overweight.
      Similarly, an elderly and frail individual person may be in the normal
      weight category when they have little muscle mass and a high percentage of
      body fat. BMI, when used for children and adolescents who are still
      growing, those with large body frames or petite builds, pregnant women and
      highly muscled individuals thus need to be assessed and interpreted
      carefully.
